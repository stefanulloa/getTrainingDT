# getTrainingDT
Code for obtaining training dataset from AFEW-VA database\n
This dataset will be used to built a custom dataset for an image recognition CNN \\n
The code is specific for Windows because of use of '\\' when referencing some paths;\n
to be used on Ubuntu, these lines will have to be manually changed.\n\n

To be done:\n
- Waiting for refatoring so that it does not need explicit use of '/' or '\\' slashes \n
when referencing paths\n
- Specify data files and directories structure, as well as database source
