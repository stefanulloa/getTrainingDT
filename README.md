# getTrainingDT
Obtain training dataset info from AFEW-VA database
This dataset will be used to built a custom dataset for an image recognition CNN
The code is specific for Windows because of use of '\' when referencing some paths;
to be used on Ubuntu, these lines will have to be manually changed.

To be done:
- Waiting for refatoring so that it does not need explicit use of '/' or '\' slashes 
when referencing paths
- Specify data files and directories structure, as well as database source
